# Tech Tips Auto (GitHub Pages + Actions)

This repo is a fully automated tech-tips blog. A GitHub Action runs daily, picks a templated tech tip from `tips.json`, creates a Jekyll post under `_posts/`, and pushes it â€” GitHub Pages serves the site.

**Set up**: follow instructions in the repo wiki or the setup steps in README.
